# Dark Fem

hello hello!

this is a little side project I've got going on

### Description

It's inspired by Aphodite goddess of love! Goddess of love and beauty born of no man nor woman but by ... _other means_.

"_...and this portion allotted to her amongst men and the undying gods, -- the whisperings of maidens and smiles deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness_"
-Hesiod, Theogony (trans. Evelyn-White)
